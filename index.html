        <h2>How I started Building Interfaces</h2>
        <p class="meta">September 25,2024 by John Doe</p>

         <img src="post1.jpg" alt="UI sketch" class="post-img left" width="200" height="140">

         <p> My journey into building interfaces started in a high school project which later aroused my curiosity. I wanted to know how the apps and
    websites I used every day were created, and why some felt easier to use than others. At first,
    I experimented with simple HTML pages and basic CSS, which encouraged me to learn more about how design and code work together to create experiences
    that people enjoy using. </p>


        <p>After that project in high school, I was left wanting to explore more about webpages, so I went to a university to study computer science and 
            grasped at the oppurtunity to learn and develop my skills in making websites and webpages.</p>

      <h2>Designing for Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="meta">September 20, 2025 by Shevar Roulston</p>

      <img src="post2.jpg" alt="Accessible design" class="post-img right" width="200" height="140">

      <p>
        Accessibility is not an afterthought â€” it should be part of the design process from day one.
        Simple actions such as choosing readable type sizes, ensuring proper color contrast and
        logical tab order make a site usable for more people.
      </p>

      <p>
        I try to include alt text for images, avoid relying on color alone to convey information,
        and test interfaces with keyboard navigation. These small steps produce big improvements
        in overall inclusivity.
