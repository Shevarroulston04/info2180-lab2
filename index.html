        <h2>How I started Building Interfaces</h2>
        <p class="meta">September 25,2024 by Shevar Roulston</p>

         <img src="post1.jpg" alt="UI " class="post-img-left">

         <p> My journey into building interfaces started in a high school project which later aroused my curiosity. I wanted to know how the apps and
    websites I used every day were created, and why some felt easier to use than others. At first,
    I experimented with simple HTML pages and basic CSS, which encouraged me to learn more about how design and code work together to create experiences
    that people enjoy using. </p>


        <p>After that project in high school, I was left wanting to explore more about webpages, so I went to a university to study computer science and 
            grasped at the oppurtunity to learn and develop my skills in making websites and webpages.</p>

      <h2>Designing for Accessibility</h2>

         Graphic design is more than just making things look attractive—it is about
    creating visual communication that tells a story. Whether it’s a logo,
    poster, or a social media post, design has the power to capture attention
    and leave a lasting impression.

        I enjoy exploring how color, typography, and layout work together to guide
    the viewer’s eye and evoke emotions. Good graphic design balances
    creativity with clarity, ensuring that the message is both beautiful and
    easy to understand. For me, it’s exciting to transform simple ideas into
    visuals that connect with people on a deeper level.
